Day 27/30

Quote of the day: Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.

It is always hard to manage multiple things at once and there lies it's beauty. You find the level to which you can stretch working. Being in a same situation, I chose to read about something related I am working on lately. I chose an article "Choosing the right Encoding method-Label vs OneHot Encoder" to get a clear understanding of which encoding scheme to use on the basis of the datset. This article gives a good idea about the encoding methods and their implementation with the difference that comes in the output.
