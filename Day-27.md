Day 27/30

Quote of the day:

It is always hard to manage multiple things at once and there lies it's beauty. You find your level to which you can stretch working. Being in a same situation, I chose to read about something related I am working on lately. I chose an article "Choosing the right Encoding method-Label vs OneHot Encoder" to get a clear understanding of which encoding scheme to use on the basis of the datset.
