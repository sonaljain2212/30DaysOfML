#30daysoftechreading

Day 1/30

*Quote of the day*: You gotta just start and be consistent, things will fall into picture!!

So this is my first day of #30daysoftechreading challenge inspired by #100daysofcodechallenge by Akriti Chadda and I can’t tell you how excited I am to do this :)

For my first day I wanted to keep it rather a brush-up day so I chose to watch a video on “Supervised Machine Learning Review” which covers the basics of Machine Learning  and the Math behind it (which is the most important part!! ). Here’s the link to it:

It covers the foundational algorithms such as Regression and Classification and the intuition behind it which could even be the starting questions for job interviews. It also covers the most important concept which is the Bias-Variance trade-off that is a must for understanding and choosing algorithms while working on any dataset or problem. It would help in choosing the right algorithm according to the model complexity and performance. 

Now, here comes the most interesting part, most of us are aware of the trade-off story of the standard statistical Machine Learning models. But, have you ever seen a modern trade-story based on Neural-Nets? How the test error decreases as we increase the model complexity and why the larger neural-nets are better but the larger statistical ML models are worse? If not, go check-out this link. It is super-informative and it will definitely help us in gaining some foundational ML skills.
