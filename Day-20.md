Day 20/20

Quote of the day:

Today I thought of brushing up my statistics basics so chose to read about Hypothesis testing. I referred "Hypothesis testing in Machine learning using Python" article for this. Well probably all who are beginner in machine learning or in intermediate level or statistic student heard about this buzz word hypothesis testing.

- What is hypothesis testing??

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. Hypothesis Testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter.

ex: Rise in stock price is due to elections.

Hypothesis testing is an essential procedure in statistics. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. When we say that a finding is statistically significant, it’s thanks to a hypothesis test.

- Which are important parameter of hypothesis testing ?
Null hypothesis :- In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups. In other words it is a basic assumption or made based on domain or problem knowledge.

Example : a company production is = 50 unit/per day etc.

- Alternative hypothesis :-
The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that is contrary to the null hypothesis. It is usually taken to be that the observations are the result of a real effect (with some amount of chance variation superposed)

Example : a company production is !=50 unit/per day etc.

- Level of significance: Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null-hypothesis. 100% accuracy is not possible for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis, so we therefore select a level of significance that is usually 5%.

This is normally denoted with alpha(maths symbol ) and generally it is 0.05 or 5% , which means your output should be 95% confident to give similar kind of result in each sample.
  - Type I error or False Positive: When we reject the null hypothesis, although that hypothesis was true. Type I error is denoted by alpha. In hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the critical region is called the alpha region.

  - Type II errors or False Negative: When we accept the null hypothesis but it is false. Type II errors are denoted by beta. In Hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the acceptance region is called the beta region.

- P-value :- The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis (H 0) of a study question is true — the definition of ‘extreme’ depends on how the hypothesis is being tested.

If your P value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject the null hypothesis i.e. accept that your sample gives reasonable evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. It does NOT imply a “meaningful” or “important” difference; that is for you to decide when considering the real-world relevance of your result.
Example : you have a coin and you don’t know whether that is fair or tricky so let’s decide null and alternate hypothesis
