Day-24/30

Quote of the day: “That's what life is for: dreaming and chasing that dream!”

For today's read I found a very good video on "Neural Network Architectures for Images" which covers Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Residual Nets, Encoder-decoder nets, and autoencoders, along with the idea that you sometimes want to spare nets from needing to learn things you already know. It also discusses tasks including classification, segmentation, denoising, blind deconvolution, superresolution, and inpainting.

Do check-out the above link for the details and I will be adding content about the concepts discussed in the video soon.
