#### 30daysoftechreading

I have been following a lot of Women in Tech and every day I see a lot of content they post regarding Data Science, Machine Learning, jobs in the Market, negotiating salaries, and so on. Being inspired by so many women like Sundas Khalid, Vidya Srinivasan, Farah Khurrum, Akriti Chadda, and many more who continuously push each other to grow and do better, I thought I wanna do something similar!! I got motivated by Akriti Chadda's #100daysofcodechallenge and thought of doing #30daysoftechreading wherein I'll be reading articles, papers and watch videos every day and share those content and insights with everyone.
