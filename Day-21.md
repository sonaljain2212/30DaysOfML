Day 21/30

Quote of the Day: Cleaning and organizing is a practice, not a project.

They say "Garbage in, garbage out". What I meant by this is if you give unclean data to a model, it will predict irrelavant results!!
Whenever you start working on a new dataset or project, What is the first step you do? I assume Data Cleaning!! Today I thought of checking out the data cleaning techniques and for that I read "The Ultimate Guide to Data Cleaning" article.

The Workflow:

The workflow is a sequence of three steps aiming at producing high-quality data and taking into account all the criteria weâ€™ve talked about.

Inspection: Detect unexpected, incorrect, and inconsistent data.
Cleaning: Fix or remove the anomalies discovered.
Verifying: After cleaning, the results are inspected to verify correctness.
Reporting: A report about the changes made and the quality of the currently stored data is recorded.
