Quote of the day:

Ever thought of doing a cool project trying your hands on text mining but stuck at where to start? How to get the important information from the gazillion strings of data? I would suggest starting with regex here. Read this very simple yet very comprehensive article “A simple intro to Regex with Python”.

Regular expressions are used to identify whether a pattern exists in a given sequence of characters (string) or not and also to locate the position of the pattern in a corpus of text.They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a pre-requisite for data science projects that involve text analytics.

In Python, there is a built-in module called re, which needs to be imported for working with Regex.

```
import re
```
