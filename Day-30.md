The Final Day!! 30/30

Quote of the day: Finish what you started!!

I wanted to finish this series yesterday on the occasion of women's day. The main reason I started this was by being inspired by so many women in tech around me. Unfortunately, my last few days have been very hectic. Nevertheless, I chose to read a paper today titled "Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Visual Classification". This paper explaines, how several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently misclassify adversarial examplesâ€”inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. This paper introduces a general attack algorithm, Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2), to generate robust visual adversarial perturbations under different physical conditions.
