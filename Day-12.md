Day 12/30

Quote of the day: It always seems impossible until it
is done.

It is always a good thing to learn conceptually in ML but if you don't know how to apply those concepts, you need to rethink on the learning process. Thus, Today I chose to train  a classifier on the MNIST dataset following a youtube video.

This dataset is available in TorchVision. I trained a fully-connected neural network with 2 hidden layers and ReLU activations.

Before starting on this, I would recommend you to read my Day-4 content on “Understanding PyTorch with an example: a step-by-step tutorial”. This article would definitely help in gaining hold on the understanding of Pytorch commands and framework.
